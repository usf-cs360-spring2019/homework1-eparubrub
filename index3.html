      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
          The following data visualizations are from the 
          <a href = "https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783">SFPD Incidents</a> 
          dataset for the month of December 2018. All visualizations include a screenshot of a tableau worksheet that I created in the
          top square. In the bottom square, there is a d3 implementation of the tableau visualization.
      </p>
      <h2 id="vis1">Visualization 1</h2>
      <div class="tableau_div">
          <img src="tab_vis/vis1.png" class="tableau_vis"/>
      </div>
      
      <!-- <svg id="vis1" width="100%" height="400" style="margin-bottom: 0px; background-color: whitesmoke; border: 1px solid black;"> -->
        <script src="d3vis1.js"></script>
      <!-- </svg> -->

      <h3>Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
          This visualization uses a line chart in order to analyze the frequency of police incident reports by the hour 
          of day. 
      </p>
      <h3>Discussion</h3>
      <p>
         I chose to visualize this because I thought it would be interesting to see what times of the day might have more frequency of 
         incidents. As we can see, there is a very large dip in occurences between the hours of 12AM and 8AM while incidents 
         peak at around 12PM and 6PM.
      </p>

      <svg width="100%" height="400" style="margin-bottom: 0px; background-color: whitesmoke; border: 1px solid black;">
      </svg>

      <h3>Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
          This visualization uses a bar chart in order to analyze the frequency of police incident reports according to the top 
          10 most frequently reported categories.
      </p>
      <h3>Discussion</h3>
      <p>
        I chose to visualize the top categories of incidents that were reported because I thought it would be interesting 
        to see what types of incidents happened more frequently than others. As we can see, larcency theft occured much more 
        frequently than the other categories listed. 
      </p>

      <div class="tableau_div">

      </div>
      <svg width="100%" height="400" style="margin-bottom: 0px; background-color: whitesmoke; border: 1px solid black;">
      </svg>

      <h3>Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
          This visualization uses a stacked bar chart in order to analayze the frequency of specific categories of incident 
          reports within the Tenderloin. These categories are the top 5 most frequently reported categories in the Tenderloin 
          neighborhood.
      </p>
      <h3>Discussion</h3>
      <p>
        This visualization was made because I was curious to know the different categories of incidents that happened in the 
        area with the most incidents. According to the data, I found that the neighborhood with the most reported incidents was 
        the tenderloin. From there, I went to see the top categories of incidents and came up with the idea of using a stacked 
        bar in order to compare the occurences of the categories. We can see that larcency theft dominates most of the graph but 
        other categories can take a considerable chunk as well.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, it was very interesting to be able to use the data from the 
        <a href = "https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783">SFPD</a> 
        and visualize the different aspects of incidents that occur throughout San Francisco.

              <br/>
              My name is Emmit Kamakaniʻoluʻoluʻokoʻolau Kahaʻulelio Parubrub and I am a student at the University of San Francisco 
              majoring in Computer Science. I was born on the island of Oahu, Hawaiʻi and raised in Kahaluʻu. I love being in the ocean, 
              the mountains, or the gym but I have always been fascinated with technology. When I was a child my environment was very 
              rural and filled with nature so when I would see new technology I would be interested and intrigued by how it worked. 
              I am majoring in computer science to foster child-like fascination and passion for technology.
